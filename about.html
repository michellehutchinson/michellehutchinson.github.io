<h1 class ="header2">About Me
</h1>

<p class="abtme">	I am a student enrolled in the Social Service Worker Program (Fast Track) at George Brown College in Toronto, Ontario. I'm set to graduate in May 2019. My previous education is an Honours BA in Psychology from York University (2013), and an Honours BA in English, also from York University (2011).
</p>

<p class="abtme">	I have over 5 years of experience working in Administrative roles at a variety of companies including a medical group, an Employee and Family Assistance (EFAP) provider, and the municipal government. Currently, I am working part-time as a Cashier/Customer Service Representative at Loblaws.
</p>

<p class="abtme">	As an employee, I am hard-working, loyal, and dedicated. I excel in fast-paced environments where I am forced to think on my feet and reorganize priorities on the go.
</p>

<p class="abtme">	In my personal time, I enjoy watching television, reading, journalling, crocheting, practicing calligraphy, and spending time with my friends.
