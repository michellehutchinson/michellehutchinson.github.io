<h1 class ="header2">About Me
</h1>

<p class="abtme">	I have a strong administrative background with over 5 years of experience in administrative roles. I have worked in a variety of businesses including a land surveying company, a medical group, and university administration.
</p>

<p class="abtme">	I am a dedicated and hard worker, who is always interested in new opportunities for growth. My personal goals include obtaining a Masters degree in psychology and continuing on to become a registered therapist.</p>

<p class="abtme">	My hobbies include crocheting, calligraphy, reading, television, video games, baking, and cooking.
</p>

<p class="abtme">	I like: tea, watching hockey games, colouring, meticulous spelling and grammar, bunnies, spending time with friends, stationery, camping, and taking walks in places where the city meets nature.
</p>

<p class="abtme">	I don't like: negativity, disorderliness, sports that aren't hockey, and coffee.
