<p>
	Hi, I'm Michelle. I am a Social Service Worker student at George Brown College in Toronto, Ontario. 
</p>
<p>
	I created this website as a way to learn and practice new technology skills, as well as a way to put myself out there and network with all kinds of wonderful people!
</p>
<p>
	I have two Bachelors degrees from York University (English in 2011 and Psychology in 2013). Following my time at York, I spent some time working in various sectors as an administrative assistant, always with the idea that some day I would go back to school and persue a Master's degree in psychology or social work. In 2018, after realising that administrative work was definitely not my calling, I returned to school at George Brown to get my diploma in Social Service Work and hopefully start on the path to gaining my Master's degree.
</p>
<p>
	As of July 2019, I am well on my way to completing my program at George Brown and earning my diploma. I am currently in a placement at Good Foot Delivery a social enterprise and charity in Toronto that hires people with developmental disabilities to work as couriers throughout the city using a combination of transit and their own two feet. 
</p>
<p>
	I'm also working part time at Loblaws in the front end of the store. When I'm there, I'm doing a combination of things from customer service, cashier, running the self-checkout machines, PC Express (gathering groceries for people who have placed online orders), and generally whatever needs to be done to keep the cashier lanes, self checkout lanes, and customer service desk running as efficiently and effectively as possible.
</p>
<p>
	In what free time I have, I like to play video games (my current fascination is with No Man's Sky), watch TV (I'm making my way through Riverdale and Queer Eye, and some of my favourites include Archer, Brooklyn 99, Bojack Horseman, Gilmore Girls, Jane the Virgin, and Good Girls), crochet, spend time with my friends, and cook or bake. 
</p>
<p>
	My taste in music is pretty eclectic - Taylor Swift is a long-time favourite, and I also love P!nk and Ke$ha as well as Mother Mother, Birds of Bellwoods, Black Eyed Peas, Miyavi, Gackt, The GazettE, ELLEGARDEN, and so many more artists.
</p>
<p>
	If you'd like to learn more about me, I invite you to contact me using the link above or to check out my resume.
