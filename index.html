ABOUT ME	
</p>
<p>
My name is Michelle, and I created this website as a way to introduce myself while learning and practicing new technology-based skills in HTML and CSS. 
</p>
<p>
I am passionate about comprehensive sex education, and my eventual career goal is to own a sex therapy practice focusing on helping LGBT youth overcome mental health challenges.
</p>
<p>
I like to spend time with friends, play video games (The Sims franchise is a favourite, and a recent fascination is No Man's Sky. I also loved Mario + Rabbids: Kingdom Battle and Zelda: Breath of the Wild), crochet, read, cook, bake, and spend time with my pet rabbit <a href="links/Pixel.jpg" target="_blank">Pixel</a>.
